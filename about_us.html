            <p>At Musttry PH, we believe that great food doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated.</p><br>
            <p>Sometimes, all it takes is a banana. Our mission is to inspire home cooks, students, moms, and</p><br>
            <p>aspiring food entrepreneurs to rediscover the value of this simple fruit that grows </p><br>
            <p>in nearly every corner of the Philippines.</p><br>
            <p>We’re proud to celebrate Filipino creativity, resourcefulness, and love for food</p><br>

            <h3>Sherilyn Sanchez</h3>
            <p>Executive Group General Manager</p>
                I am a student and the General Manager of our Web Development project, where we created a digital<br>
                cookbook. We believe that cooking is more than just preparing meals — it’s an expression of love, creativity,<br>
                and culture. Through every recipe, we share a story, a memory, and a piece of who we are. Our passion for<br>
                cooking comes from the joy it brings to others and the connections it creates around the table. As a team,<br>
                we poured our hearts into this project to celebrate the beauty of homemade dishes. This cookbook is our<br>
                way of inspiring others to cook with love and purpose.

            <h3>Jannalyn Ycoy</h3>
            <p>Web Developer</p>
                I am a student and part of our Web Development project team. My role as a web developer allows me to <br>
                turn ideas into something real and interactive. Working on this digital cookbook, I discovered how <br>
                technology and creativity can come together to share something meaningful. Cooking may be an art, <br>
                but building a platform that brings recipes to life is just as rewarding. Every line of code we wrote <br>
                was inspired by our love for food and the stories behind each dish. As a student developer, I’m proud <br>
                to help create a space where people can connect, cook, and be inspired.</p><br>
